In 2019, I helped launch a software developer-focused podcast at BriteCore entitled ["DevBrite"](https://anchor.fm/devbrite). Episode contents are casual conversations about software engineering, insurance, technology, and management with BriteCore engineers. The episode cadence is sporadic and unpredictable, so be warned!  Give it a listen if this sounds up your alley!
