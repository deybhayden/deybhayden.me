DotFiles: Configuration Chemistry
=================================

My [DotFiles](https://github.com/deybhayden/DotFiles) repository contains a modern Bash setup with several git and docker aliases, an expansive [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) Vim 8+ setup, and a [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) configuration. It also has some various configuration files for macOS. To link these files, I recommend using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).
